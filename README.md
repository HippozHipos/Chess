# Chess
Chess game in c++ using pixel game engine. Its my attempt at quickly making a chess game and learning a few things about how movement of pieces work. It is highly unoptimized and
the pieces are just letters but you can move them around so thats cool. The pieces cannot actually be taken yet though.
